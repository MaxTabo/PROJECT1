# "Shark attack" project.
Maximiliano Tab√≥.
## 1-Introduction.
The goal of the project is to analyse the DataFrame based on 1 or more hypotheses made.
## 2-Hypotheses.
A-The most dangerous activity for shark attacks is surfing
B-Men are attacked much more than women
C-Australia is the country where the most shark attacks take place on earth.
D-Is the White shark the world's most lethal?
E- Youth are the most attacked by sharks.

## 3- Steps.
Based on the hypotheses made, I started cleaning the DataFrame. There were a lot of missing-value rows and unnecessary information in columns.
After that I went through REGEX to match many values that the syntax was similiar but not the same. Following that, I kept the values within certain ranges.
Fron there on, I began with the visualization to check if the hypothesis were right or not.

Hypothesis B

Hypothesis C

Hypothesis D

Hypothesis E

## 4-Conclusions.
Hypothesis A is mostly validated. The attacks are almost double in the second position. In spite of this, diving activities are more lethal.
Hypothesis B is correct. Based on the plot, men are attacked much more than women.
Hypothesis C is erroneous. The U.S.A is on top of the ranking.
As we could presupposed, White sharks are the most lethal shark on earth. Hypothesis D is positive.
For the last hypothesis we can deduce, due to that youth are more reckless than others, youth are more attacked than people of other ranges.
